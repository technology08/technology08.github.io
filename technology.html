            <h2>Leaning Eagle App</h2>
            <p>Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy approached me to prototype, design, build, distrbute, and manage an iOS application to enable online ordering for the school's coffee bar. Through conversations with the Entrepeneurial Program Director, I was able to design the app to my client's exact specifications as they adapt over time: what started out as an order-ahead app for a smoothie bar as flourished into new delivery options, payment solutions, and multiple business venues. The app utilizes Stripe and Apple Pay for secure credit card processing, CloudKit for database storage of orders and menu items, and Amazon Web Services's Lambda Cloud functions product to ensure encrypted payment calls.</p>

            <h2>AR Directions</h2>
            <p>Back in 2017, I met a friend at Apple's Worlwide Developers Conference. He was a few years my senior, yet we became good friends. In the months following the conference, over multiple FaceTime conference calls and GitHub commits, built a prototype of an augmented reality turn-by-turn navigation app, which we (quite creatively) called <em>ARDirections</em>.
            <br> <br> Through this process, my friend acted as a mentor for me. As this was the summer after my seventh grade, he introduced me to new concepts in mathematics and computer science. I quickly learned how the unit circle, a term my thirteen-year-old self had previously never heard of, could be used to map real-world latitude and longitude coordinates to the three-dimensional virtual coordinate space of an iPhone’s augmented reality world view.  
            <!-- <br> <br> While this app never became a commercially available app on the App Store (due to some legal considerations regarding patents), this experience not only showed me how to create an app from start to finish, but also how to collaborate with another software engineer to solve a technical problem.  --></p>

            <h2>Robotics ML Vision</h2>
            <p>From April 2018 through January 2019, I developed an iPhone-based computer vision solution for my FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4028. I intended to build off my previous iOS experience with <em>AR Directions</em> and utilize Apple's faster SoCs and machine learning APIs (Vision, Core ML) to build an object detection mechanism faster and more accurate than any of our competitors could offer.
            <!-- <br> <br> -->For networking, WiFi communications are not permitted in FRC matches; thus, we utilized Ethernet and <a href="https://github.com/Kitura/BlueSocket" target="_blank"> IBM's BlueSocketNetworking API</a> to leverage low-level TCP sockets to send discrete data packets to the robot. For computer vision, we explored OpenCV, Apple's Vision framework, and custom machine learning models with Turi Create and Core ML, before selecting Core Image color filters and Apple's Vision rectangle detection framework. This one-of-a-kind FRC vision solution has never been used on any other team to date and provided a uniquely personal solution to FRC vision tracking.
