                <p>Technology has always been an integral part of my identity. In middle school, I taught myself Python & iOS App Development with Swift. Once I discovered molecular biology, I became determined to use technology to find medical solutions. Here, I have highlighted some interdisciplinary projects to document my journey in developing my passion from childhood to present day.</p>

            <h2>WWDC18 Scholarship</h2>
            <p>In June 2018, I attended Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, CA, as one of 350 scholarship winners. My submission included essays and a physics-based 2D game built in Swift Playgrounds. Among 5,350 developers, I joined labs with Apple engineers who not only resolved bugs and suggested improvements but guided my growth as a young developer. Only 120 attendees were under 18, making this experience even more memorable.</p>

            <h2>Leaning Eagle App</h2>
            <p>My school tasked me with prototyping, designing, building, and managing an iOS app for online ordering at the school coffee bar. Collaborating with the Entrepreneurial Program Director, I adapted the app to evolving needs, expanding from an order-ahead platform to include delivery, payment solutions, and multiple business venues. The app integrates Stripe and Apple Pay for secure transactions, CloudKit for order storage, and AWS Lambda for encryption.</p>

            <h2>AR Directions</h2>
            <p>Alongside a mentor at Apple’s WWDC, I developed a prototype augmented reality navigation app, ARDirections. Due to my youth when building the project, I learned mathematics and computer science through building instead of a classroom, including how the unit circle maps real-world latitude and longitude to a 3D coordinate space within an iPhone's AR world view. This project was both a technical challenge and a pivotal learning experience in my development as a young programmer.
            <!-- <br> <br> While this app never became a commercially available app on the App Store (due to some legal considerations regarding patents), this experience not only showed me how to create an app from start to finish, but also how to collaborate with another software engineer to solve a technical problem.  --></p>

            <h2>Robotics ML Vision</h2>
            <p>I developed an iPhone-based computer vision solution for my FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4028. I intended to build off my previous iOS experience with <em>AR Directions</em> and utilize Apple's faster SoCs and machine learning APIs (Vision, Core ML) to build an object detection mechanism faster and more accurate than any of our competitors could offer.
            <!-- <br> <br> -->For networking, WiFi communications are not permitted in FRC matches; thus, we utilized Ethernet and <a href="https://github.com/Kitura/BlueSocket" target="_blank"> IBM's BlueSocketNetworking API</a> to leverage low-level TCP sockets to send discrete data packets to the robot. For computer vision, we explored OpenCV, Apple's Vision framework, and custom machine learning models with Turi Create and Core ML, before selecting Core Image color filters and Apple's Vision rectangle detection framework. This one-of-a-kind FRC vision solution has never been used on any other team to date and provided a uniquely personal solution to FRC vision tracking.

            <h2>Website Development</h2>
            <p>A software engineer mentioned that website development would be a useful tool to continue my development journey. I initially began teching myself how to build this website from raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, having no former experience and without using any templates. Along the way, I encountered an opprtunity to build a website for an investment firm in just over six weeks. I delivered, surpassing my client's expectations as I combined my experience working with a client from the Leaning Eagle App above with my newfound web development experience. For both websites, I have written every line of code myself, and for this website, all content (text and images) are designed, developed, and edited by myself. I hope to continue adding more interactive elements as my experience grows.</p>
