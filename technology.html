            <p>Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy approached me to prototype, design, build, distrbute, and manage an iOS application to enable online ordering for the school's coffee bar. Through conversations with the Entrepeneurial Program Director, I was able to design the app to my client's exact specifications as they adapt over time: what started out as an order-ahead app for a smoothie bar as flourished into new delivery options, payment solutions, and multiple business venues. The app utilizes Stripe and Apple Pay for secure credit card processing, CloudKit for database storage of orders and menu items, and Amazon Web Services's Lambda Cloud functions product to ensure encrypted payment calls.</p>
