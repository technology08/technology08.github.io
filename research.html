                <h2 class="pubtitle">An Automated Approach to Modeling Jupiter’s Synchrotron Radiation from Radio Telescope Observations </h2> <br>
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.32374/atom.2020.1.3" class="pubdoibtn" target="_blank" id="synchrotron">PDF | DOI: doi.org/10.32374/atom.2020.1.3</a> <br> <br>
                <p class="pubdescription">After taking an astronomy course in the fall of freshman year, I then worked in a group of two other students to publish our paper on synchrotron radiation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in her Astronomical Research Seminar. In our group, our instructor learned along with us as we analyzed models of synchrotron radiation—light emitted by charged particles moving in a curved path—for NASA’s Juno satellite instead of performing the typical analysis of a double star or exoplanet transit. However, more important than the actual science, I learned through that course, my instructor, and my teammates how to conduct scientific research going forward. 
                <br> <br> After presenting at NASA's Citizen Science Conference (shown above) in June 2019, we were published in the peer-reviewed journal <em> Astronomy Theory Observations and Methods </em> in July 2020. Our presentation was also cited by NASA's Jet Propulsion Labortory in Velusamy et al's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09184.pdf" target="_blank">"Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope Monitoring Flux Density of Jupiter's Synchrotron Radiation during the Juno Mission."</a>

                <h2 class="pubtitle">Comparing the Ages of NGC 1513 and NGC 2420</h2> <br>
                <a href="http://www.socastrosci.org/images/2020_Proceedings_final.pdf" class="pubdoibtn" target="_blank" id="ngc1513">PDF | Conference Proceedings p. 137-140</a> <br> <br>
                <p class="pubdescription">The next year, my astronomy instructor asked me to be a teaching assistant for that seminar. In the process, I led two other groups (which developed this publication and "Observation and Investigation of NGC 1662" below), both focused on analyzing star clusters. Throughout this process, I would mentor these teams once a week—directing each team by helping them find these questions they did not know they needed to ask. In particular, one group considered using a Python script to learn more about the stellar composition. I then discussed with them the goals of the project, and we realized that the script was tangential to our focus. After pivoting, I then developed other tools in Python and helped generate their figures. Most importantly, I brought my experience from the previous year and led these teams to publication by guiding them to develop a purpose, focus on the relevant information, and discover what questions need answering.</p>

                <p class="pubdescription">As noted in the above publication "Comparing the Ages of NGC 1513 and NGC 2420," this was another publication where I used my previous research experience writing and publishing "An Automated Approach..." to mentor a research team discovering double stars.</p>
