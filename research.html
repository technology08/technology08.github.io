                <p>When I was just 7 years old, I recognized I wanted to spend my life in research & development because I knew that this field would always allow me to pursue the cutting edge of new technologies that hadn’t had the chance to collect dust. I wanted to not just build the next year’s work, but the next decade’s work. And throughout my journey, my thirst for research has only expanded.</p>

                <h2 class="pubtitle">Improving Healthspan through Patient-Derived Artificial Organs from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and Two-Photon Polymerization </h2> <br>
                <a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/scn_protocols/71/" class="pubdoibtn" target="_blank" id="ipsc_senescence">PDF | UPenn Singh Center for Nanotechnology</a> <br> <br>
                <p class="pubdescription">Senescence, from the shortening of telomeres, accumulation of mutations, epigenetic hypomethylation, and other causes, begins an eventual cycle of decline in every patient. Stem cells disappear as a function of age, which in turn impairs cellular replication. Moreover, when fully differentiated cells are induced back into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), they not only revert to a state of pre-differentiation, but also to a younger cellular age. Their aging clocks turn back: their telomeres become longer and DNA methylation reverts back to an earlier age. It should therefore be possible to use iPSCs to replace the missing stem cells from aged organs and tissues and to replace existing, older tissue with younger cells. In order to accomplish this, this paper will also explore new nanotechnological mechanisms in generating patient-specific scaffolds, including two-photon polymerization, a fabrication process that uses a specifically focused, near-infrared laser to build three-dimensional scaffolds. This paper finally proposes a mechanism to apply iPSCs as preventative medicine, to replace aging organs before they fail and unwind the aging clock to lengthen healthspan.</p>

                <h2 class="pubtitle">On the Soundness of Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity and its Implications on Scientific Theory & Experiments</h2> <br>
                <a href="http://cogitojournal.org/uploads/1/3/5/5/135529921/cogito_spring_issue_2021-_a_journal_of_high_school_philosophy.pdf" class="pubdoibtn" target="_blank" id="philosophy">PDF | Cogito Journal</a> <br> <br>
                <p class="pubdescription">Einstein’s development of special relativity was derived through deductive logic from
                    strong premises rather than experimentation. The two premises—the constancy of the speed of light and the principle of relativity—are strengthened through multiple methods of discovery from a range of fields. After exploring special relativity and its argument, I then detail the problems of inductive experimentation, including auxiliary hypotheses and Hume’s Problem of Induction. I then propose a new deductive science based on the same methods as Einstein: deriving theories with valid logic and rigorous premises from an existing worldview. I finally argue that experimentation then becomes a source for finding fundamental facts of a worldview to develop further theoretical theories and to supplement confirmation of a deductive theory.</p>

                <h2 class="pubtitle">An Automated Approach to Modeling Jupiter’s Synchrotron Radiation from Radio Telescope Observations </h2> <br>
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.32374/atom.2020.1.3" class="pubdoibtn" target="_blank" id="synchrotron">PDF | DOI: doi.org/10.32374/atom.2020.1.3</a> <br> <br>
                <p class="pubdescription">After taking an astronomy course in the fall of freshman year, I then worked in a group of two other students to publish our paper on synchrotron radiation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in her Astronomical Research Seminar. In our group, our instructor learned along with us as we analyzed models of synchrotron radiation—light emitted by charged particles moving in a curved path—for NASA’s Juno satellite instead of performing the typical analysis of a double star or exoplanet transit. However, more important than the actual science, I learned through that course, my instructor, and my teammates how to conduct scientific research going forward. 
                <br> <br> After presenting at NASA's Citizen Science Conference (shown above) in June 2019, we were published in the peer-reviewed journal <em> Astronomy Theory Observations and Methods </em> in July 2020. Our presentation was also cited by NASA's Jet Propulsion Labortory in Velusamy et al's <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09184.pdf" target="_blank">"Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope Monitoring Flux Density of Jupiter's Synchrotron Radiation during the Juno Mission."</a>

                <p class="pubdescription">The next year, my astronomy instructor asked me to be a teaching assistant for that seminar. In the process, I led two other groups (which developed this publication and "Observation and Investigation of NGC 1662" below), both focused on analyzing star clusters. Throughout this process, I would mentor these teams once a week—directing each team by helping them find these questions they did not know they needed to ask. In particular, one group considered using a Python script to learn more about the stellar composition. I then discussed with them the goals of the project, and we realized that the script was tangential to our focus. After pivoting, I then developed other tools in Python and helped generate their figures. Most importantly, I brought my experience from the previous year and led these teams to publication by guiding them to develop a purpose, focus on the relevant information, and discover what questions need answering.</p>

                <p class="pubdescription">As noted in the above publication "Comparing the Ages of NGC 1513 and NGC 2420," this was another publication where I used my previous research experience writing and publishing "An Automated Approach..." to mentor a research team discovering double stars.</p>
